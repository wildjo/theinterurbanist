# Community Meeting on Building Maintenance and Resident Concerns

**Date/Time:** December 12, 2025, 3:00 PM PST

## Overall Summary

The meeting addressed ongoing maintenance issues including elevator repairs, washer replacements, and garage gate timing. Residents raised concerns about lighting, safety, and technology support. Plans for community trips and waste disposal were discussed. The management committed to follow up on unresolved issues and improve communication.

## Key Points

* The South garage elevator will be down for about a week for maintenance; concerns were raised about pressure on the remaining elevator during this time
* Washers on the third floor are approved for replacement, expected to take 3-4 weeks for installation; the delay is due to availability of card readers for machines
* Garage gate speed will be checked and possibly adjusted to shorten the delay before closing; residents reminded not to let unauthorized people into the garage
* New lobby and hallway artwork is planned for next year and included in the budget considerations
* Technology support is a concern; proposal for a weekly technician or concierge to assist residents with phone and internet issues was discussed
* Enclosing the garage access stairwell has been approved with resident access being retained with special locks, no ETA specified

## Action Items

* Vendor to inspect exposed rooftop deck screws and south side LED strips dimming
* Management reiterated that rooftop LED lights should remain plugged in after an incident where they were left unplugged, leading a resident to feel unsafe traversing the deck at night while walking a pet
* Management to verify garage gate settings and ensure there is a shorter pause before closing
* Survey to be distributed within two weeks to gather resident input on shopping trips and outings
* Follow up on dryer repair on the sixth floor and washer issues reported by residents
* Explore options for technology help sessions and possibly a concierge service for residents
* Organize a bulky item disposal event with resident contributions to cover costs

## Open Questions

* Will electric car charging stations remain available after the car-sharing program is discontinued?
* Can elevator service be improved to provide weekend or faster repairs during breakdowns?
* How will painting and other aesthetic improvements be prioritized and funded next year?
