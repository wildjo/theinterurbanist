Dear Interurban Residents,

I wanted to personally share some news with you. As many of you know, I’ve been helping out at another property one day a week over the past several weeks. The company has recently decided to transition me to that community full time, beginning this coming Monday.
 
This was a decision made by the company, and not something initiated from onsite. While I understand these changes can be unexpected, please know this wasn’t an easy shift for me — and that’s entirely because of all of you.
 
Being part of this community has been one of the most meaningful experiences in my career. You’ve welcomed me, supported me, and brought so much light to my days. The notes, cards, small gifts, and kind words you’ve shared with me over time are things I treasure deeply — I’ve saved every one, and they continue to remind me why I love what I do.
 
Although I won’t be working onsite anymore, I will still be living here for the time being — so this isn’t goodbye, and I hope to continue seeing many of your familiar faces around the community.
 
Thank you for the trust, kindness, and joy you’ve given me. You’ll always hold a very special place in my heart.
 
With heartfelt gratitude,

Alison Erdman
