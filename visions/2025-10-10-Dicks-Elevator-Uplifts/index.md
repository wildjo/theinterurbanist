When was the last time you laughed in the elevator? If you live in SHAG Interurban -- as most of us do -- it was probably pretty recently.

"I put them up at 11 o’clock at night so they’re up there the next morning," says Dick Becker, who has been sharing his color reprints of the inspirational, many of them witty and thought-provoking, images he collects. "I got a pile of them and I don’t know how I collected them," shared Becker with a laugh.

Becker explained his editing process, "Every week I have two goofy posters. I’m trying to keep the attention of people with the funny stuff." For for the rest of the days each week, Becker looks for posters that will inspire people to see life from a positive viewpoint. But these are just to get people's attention. To round out the week, Becker adds posters that highlight the ways people are making a difference in their own and in other's lives.

SHAG Interurban management has been supportive. "At this age, I can’t do much, but I felt that I could do this," said Becker. "I was blown away when I gave Margaret fifteen of these [posters] and Margaret was signing them before we were done talking about it."

The posters are an extension of Becker's life's purpose, "I spent my life trying to help people," he said. "I was a religious fundamentalist growing up," he shared. "Then I met my wife [Pat] and we have been involved with making difference in thousands of peoples lives in one way or another."
