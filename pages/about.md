**The Interurbanist** is a resident-run Arts, Style, and Entertainment publication for the SHAG Interurban
community. We publish longer stories for context and short, practical notices for everyday
life. No logins, no pop-ups, just useful news and neighbor voices.

We prioritize accessibility: large type, simple navigation, and printable pages. If you
need help contributing a story, see our **[Submissions](/submissions/)** page.
